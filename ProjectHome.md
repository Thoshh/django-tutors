This is a project to host source codes and other accompanying materials for [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)-related tutorials I'm giving from time to time. This is ongoing work and I do not expect to release any _version_.

Most of the documents will be in Polish, unless somebody really ask me to write in English. Or somebody actually write something in English (or any other language).

Membership in this project is _nearly open_, drop me a line if you want to contribute, I'll grant you RW access to the repository.
